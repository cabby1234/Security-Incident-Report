# Security Incident Report
<h1>Hacking WPA/WPA2</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a security incident report I completed while studying for my Google Cybersecurity Certificate. A incident was reported where there was a possible brute force attack used to compromise the admin account.
<br />

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>

<strong>Step 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident.</strong>
 <br/>
The protocol impacted in the incident is the Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Running tcpdump and accessing the yummyrecipesforme.com website to detect the problem and capture protocol and traffic activity in a DNS & HTTP traffic log file provided the evidence needed to conclude. The malicious file is observed being transported to the usersâ€™ computers using the HTTP protocol at the application layer.
